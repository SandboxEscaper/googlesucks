# googlesucks


google deleted my blog. 
in 3 months it will be perma deleted and every technical blog that i ever wrote will be lost forever.
I suspect some stalker has been trying their best to abuse the report system because he's probably a little frustated man. Probably also abused the reporting system on twitter and got me banned.
So now impersonators can do what they want. 
I do not own a twitter. @sandboxe is not me. @bearsandbox is also not me. SandboxEscaper on telegram is also not me. If you get contacted by someone claiming to be me. Its not me. I dont talk to people.

Both twitter and google are fucking retarded. I would literally do anything to feel less alone in my apartment when I'm stuck with these dark thoughts. I don't do it for fun or shock value. It's my fucking way of coping with this shit. And all you fucktards do is censor me. You're all a bunch of cowards. 

Anyway, I'm not with Microsoft anymore and I'm going to set the world ablaze one day and hack the fbi. bye 

Edit: I've reached out to google, even reached out to their security team. Nobody is willing to help me out. I cannot even get a back-up of my blog. I can't be bothered. I'm not going to do the tedious task of copy pasting it from archive.org. If people treat me like this, then I'm not giving back to this industry either. Let half a decade worth of technical write-ups be lost then. It's this industry's loss, not mine. I'm done, done with all this bullshit, done with the stalkers, done with the impersonators, done being treated like this. Done being censored. You're all just a bunch of cowards.
