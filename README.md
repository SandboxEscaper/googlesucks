# googlesucks


google deleted my blog. 
in 3 months it will be perma deleted and every technical blog that i ever wrote will be lost forever.
I suspect some stalker has been trying their best to abuse the report system because he's probably a little frustated man. Probably also abused the reporting system on twitter and got me banned.
So now impersonators can do what they want. 
I do not own a twitter. @sandboxe is not me. @bearsandbox is also not me. SandboxEscaper on telegram is also not me. If you get contacted by someone claiming to be me. Its not me. I dont talk to people.

Anyway, I'm not with Microsoft anymore and I'm going to set the world ablaze one day and hack the fbi. bye
